Bonuses are usually paid out in money. Like in the
[example in my earlier post](/blog/2013/12/07/why-bonuses-dont-work/) where a sales person
gets a $200 bonus when he closes five deals per week. Money can be a
powerful incentive. Remember when you were small, and your parents or
your grandparents promised you money in return for a small chore? And
that feeling that you got when you got the reward? Do you still have it
when you get your paycheck? If you do, you are one of the lucky ones,
because most people get used to it. When you were small, it was a
[_reward_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounty_(reward\)), but when you receive your paycheck, it is what you [_earned_](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/earn).
See how that is different? By saying that you earn it, you say you _deserve_ the reward.

Bonuses have that same effect on people, at
least when they are poorly constructed, as is
[often the case](http://agile.dzone.com/articles/bonus-system). As I
mentioned in an [earlier post](/blog/2013/12/07/why-bonuses-dont-work/),
in my opion, a good, conststructive bonus should be
designed in a way that all parties benefit from it. Everybody involved
in the reaching of the target that initiates the reward should have equal
benefit of the reward. This might seem very complex, but as with so many
things: keeping our eye on the actual goal can help to keep it simple.
In order to do so, we should ask ourselves the right questions. Ask
every party involved the same questions and the bonus will present
itself.

## Ask the Right Questions

The hard part about asking questions is to not think about some solution
you subcontiously have for a problem. Meaning that if you already
thought of a solution, or if you are depending on a solution other
people came up with for a similar problem, you will never get there.
Every question you will ask in that situation will only bring you closer
to the solution you are biased towards, and, possibly, further away from
your goal. In my opinion, it is always better to think for 45 minutes
about something and conclude that you were right before you started
thinking than going with your first hunch and learn that you were wrong
afterwards. So, forget bonuses and ask yourself these questions.

Start with yourself. Or your company, if you are in a management
position and you need to solve a problem for the company you work for.
Beginning with your own needs, rather than those of other people
involved is very important. You know most about your needs, and as you
go step by step towards a solution, it is important to keep your error
margins as small as possible. Knowing your own needs is far easier than
those of someone else, so start here.

### What do I want?

Let us say that, in the sales person example from earlier, we are that
sales person's boss.  What we want to achieve is that our sales force
is motivated to close as many deals as possible. Motivation is key here,
because motivated people are happiest and they can set their own
increasing standards. This would serve us very well, because we do not
even have to bother setting targets for them, as they will do that for
themselves. That almost sounds to good to be true, maybe, but it is want
we want.

### What do my people want?

Again, start closest to yourself and work from there. You know more
about your colleagues than you know from your future customers you have
not met yet. Ask them what they want, but try to avoid giving them more
money. Money tends to make them dependend on it. It changes their
lifestyle, and once it does, it is hard to go back without getting into
trouble. More importantly, it will no longer feel as a reward, once they
get used to it. Ask them how they want to develop themselves as a
person instead. Helping them develop skills builds trust.

The skills they learn while they work for you serves them well, now and in the
future. Whether they will keep working for you in the future or not does
not matter. This will build trust between you and your workforce. As
they improve their skills, they will perform better on the job you give
them, and they will be thankful for it because you give them the chance
to develop themselves. They can take those skills anywhere they want,
and they will know that. The longer they keep working for you the
happier they will be as a result; because they have been with you for
so long. That is just the way
[this works](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance).

### What do my customers want?

![motivational quote](http://i.imgflip.com/5byx0.jpg)
It can be hard to figure out what potential customers want. If present,
start with the customers you already have. Ask them what they want or
need to close a deal. Be specific though, do not ask them what they want
from you in general, but what would make them interested to make the
deal. If you are just starting out, you will not have any customers to
ask this, and you will have to put yourself in their position.

You could also do a survey among potential buyers, but finding potential buyers
puts you in the same pickle. To find potential buyers you will, again,
have to put yourself in their position, so I would not bother with that.
I am not a sales person so I lack the experience, but I would think that
you can use the same principle that worked so well when you were small
and your daddy gave you some money for mowing the lawn or something. The
effect of giving a buyer something in return for their trust when they
make a deal with you will not wear off, since they will only make that
first deal with you once.

After that, you have to keep them as a customer,
but you can worry about that later. When someone is already a person
that you know, it will be easier to find out what keeps them motivated.
So, offer them something, anything: a discount, a gadget, a night out
with their family, anything goes. As long as it either stands out, or is
substantial enough to take away the reluctance they might have. Let your
sales people come up with ideas and help them develop better ideas while
they work for you. They are closest to your clients, which is why they
should know best.

## A System That Serves Everybody

So, what we have now is a clear perspective on what we want from the
people that work for us: self-motivated people. We motivate them by
helping them develop as a person, which will keep them loyal and happy.
Our customers get something out of closing the deal too, as a thank you
for their trust. The effect of the bonus will not wear off. And if it
does, it usually means they are getting to good for the job, or they are
never getting good enough. Promote them, give them another job, or fire
them if needed.
