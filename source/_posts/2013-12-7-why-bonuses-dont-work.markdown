Bonuses are a [common motivational tool](http://www.pe.com/business/business-columns/practical-business-radical-headlines/20131109-practical-business-radical-focus-on-motivation.ece). Whenever an employee hits his
target, he is given a reward. This can be anything, but is usually
[money](http://www.ecsellinstitute.com/blog/bid/47424/). While this may seem to be a positive way to motivate your workforce,
the impact of a bonus system can be devastating on the employees, the
company they work for, and the companies they are in business with. In
my opinion, the reason for this is that bonuses are [often poorly engineered](http://agile.dzone.com/articles/bonus-system). TL;DR: the bonus in itself should have
a common benefit on both the goal (e.g. hitting that target) and the
people reaching that goal (the employee, the client). But it can be difficult to
find such an incentive, and if you fail, it might backfire.

## A Common Bonus Scenario

Consider a regular sales person who needs to close five deals per week.
Whenever he hits this target, he receives a bonus. The most common bonus
is some amount of money, so let's say he receives $200 for reaching that
goal. Hitting that target is hard, but doable, so he manages to reach
this target every other week. This adds $400 to his monthly salary and
his lifestyle changes accordingly, which means he needs that money to
come by every month.

After a few months, he is getting better at his
job, more experienced. Hitting the target is still a challenge, but
sometimes he manages to close six deals in a week. This does not happen
a lot, and very irregularly, but it happens. At first, he is happy about
it, and his boss is happy too. He gets a pat on the shoulder from her,
but his bonus stays at $200. In the beginning he does not care, but
after a couple of times this begins to bug him. He talks to his boss
about it and she says that if he manages to bring in seven deals per week,
he will receive a $250 bonus, $50 for just two more deals. That seems
fair to him.

But in the weeks after that, he finds that closing seven deals
is near impossible and he starts to mope. So, he finds another way to
earn more money. A couple of weeks later, when he is on the brink of
closing his sixth deal that week, it becomes clear to him that he should
rather postpone the deal until the next week. This gives him a headstart into
next week, and a bigger chance to cash in, because
he only needs four more deals to close to receive another bonus.

This line of thinking has no downside to him. He will receive his bonus this
week and as a result of his cheating, he will have a bigger chance on
receiving another bonus next week. But, there are downsides for another
party in this deal, his employer. The company he works for lost two
things probably and maybe even $200 on another bonus that will not have
the effect it was meant to have on their sales person.

## How a Bad Bonus Backfires

The two things it lost probably are a a tool that keeps him motivated
for one, and his trust for another. At the very least, the workings of
the bonus is no longer regulated by the company or the boss he works
for, but by him. And he will probably feel that power too. He will
probably also feel that he needs to do this, that it is fair somehow,
and that his boss or the company they work for does not understand what he
is doing. Maybe not that strong, but he will sense a gap between his
needs and the needs of his employer. The exact opposite of what the bonus
was intended to be for.

And keep in mind that this is only a small scale
example. There are far more powerful people than this sales person
around that get paid in bonuses. The banking industry, for instance is
[STILL crowded](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2515787/Greedy-bankers-STILL-dont-Bonus-culture-returns-vengeance-years-crash-2-700-British-bankers-pocket-average-1-6million.html) with them.
