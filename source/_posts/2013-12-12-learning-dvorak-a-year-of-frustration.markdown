It's been a year now, since I started learning Dvorak. And it has been a year full of frustration. The reason for me to make the switch to another keyboard layout was merely a matter of principle. The Qwerty layout that I used before, and the most common keyboard interface in the Western world was designed for [Remington typewriters][1] in 1873. They have these metal arms, called typebars, and this layout was designed to prevent jams of the typebars when typing fast. This means that keys that were often used sequentially in words could not be to close to each other or the arms would grip into each other and the typewriter would jam.

## Common standards

Now, I am all for common standards, but this seems to me like a relic from the past. Therefore I started looking into other layouts, and I was intrigued by the idea behind the [Dvorak simplified keyboard layout][2] from 1936. The keys on a Dvorak keyboard are arranged in a way that allows me to type this blog post with less finger motions than it would have taken me on a Qwerty layout. This would increase my typing speed and accuracy. All I had to do was learn to type again.

## How it affected my communication

In my daily work I communicate almost solely through my computer. We have four main channels of communication: one-on-one Instant Messaging when you need an answer right away, [Campfire][3] group chat for when you need an answer sometime today, [Asana][4] for tasks and projects, and a Facebook-like clone when an answer is not needed, but you want to share something anyway. The main reason for these lines of communication is not to disturb colleagues unnecessarily in their workflow. Nothing kills performance like colleagues showing up at your desk all day. Also, it gives you the liberty to choose which messages to ignore for now, and which ones to act on immediately, without being rude. My communication shrieked to a sudden halt when I switched to Dvorak.

Although I practiced very hard with an excellent typing program called [Type Fu][5], I found myself more often than not in a chat with a colleague where he or she would ask me something, and I started typing - very slowly - then they typed four or five other messages while I was still responding to the first. Then I would hit "send" and everybody was confused. At many occasions I tried switching back to Qwerty, only finding that I totally forgot where the keys were on that. There was no going back. Frustration.

## How it affected my work

I am a programmer. Besides communication, my day job consists of writing code. One writes the best code without distractions. That is why we use ancient but sophisticated [terminal][6] based text editors, like [Vim][7], only to get rid of the distractions of a mouse or a touch pad. We like clean programming languages like [Ruby][8], and why we spend a lot of time automating stuff that we do repeatedly. I do all that stuff too, that is why I found the idea of switching to Dvorak so interesting in the first place! I love the idea of typing without distractions, finger motions, invented in ancient times for hardware that we stopped using _decades_ ago. (Actually, I learned typing on a typewriter when I was seven years old or so, but two years later I got my first PC). Anyway, writing code while you have to concentrate on typing is many of too many things all at once.

I did not want to loose my job over this of course, so every night I practiced and I practiced until I could not feel my fingers anymore. This went on for two months or so. Then I reached the point where I would type 30 WPM (Words per minute). That is slow. To compare: I came from 100 WPM on Qwerty before the switch, which is not very fast either by the way. A lot of people I know do 120 WPM easily. Actually, if you are reading this, and you are thinking about making the switch to Dvorak (despite my warnings), and you are on 120 WPM+, do not even think about switching! Please, take my advice, it is *not* worth it!

## I like to think it was worth it

For me it was - wort it - in the end. But only because I was not such a good typer to begin with. I could have solved that probably by practicing my skills on Qwerty, but I guess I am just too lazy for that. The fact that I had to learn to type all over again made me do it. It has been a year now, and I gave up practicing a few months ago. I am at 110 WPM. Still not very fast, but faster than I was by 10 WPM and I am still improving - just by typing. I like to think that is the Dvorak effect. :) Am I crazy?
